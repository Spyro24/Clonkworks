This rule enables forging, and stores important information for the forge to use!
if you wanna add a material to be used in the forge, paste this into a scenario script's initialize function, or anywhere if you wanna make an unlockable or something else:

  FindObject2(Find_ID(FALW))->AddForgeable(METL, RGBa(177, 171, 170, 0), 3, 34, 2, "LavaLQM")
					                      1        2                    3   4  5  6

1. Id of the object
2. Color of things made with object
3. Mass Multiplier
4. Speed Ticks (In forged items with aiming, values above 37 get turned to 37. )
5. Power (Not related Electricity/Health by default)
6. Forge Effect
