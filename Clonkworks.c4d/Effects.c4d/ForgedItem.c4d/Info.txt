* Glide - This object will slowly glide down instead of falling, glide speed based on Mass in the forge material list.
* Toxic - Like Burnable > Fuming, but doesn't require fire to work.

* Glow - The object will have its own area of vision
* Explode - The Object will explode when falling from a great height
* Fragile - The Object will break when falling from a great height

* Sticky - The object will stick to whatever it hits for a short time.
* Bouncy - Makes the object bounce off the ground and walls.
* Attractive - Makes the object affected by magnets.


you are free to add your own, just dont edit this one! overload it then edit or edit it with system.c4g. unless you wanna edit effects for every scenario and (kinda) ruin it.
if you are adding effects to the mod and not for your own stuff, do so here in the script freely ;)

if you pick set the local variable Effect to something that is not on the list, the string will be interpreted as a name of an effect and not a list of forge effects, allowing you to use global effects.
the timer is set to 1 tick.
