<p align="center">From rocks to steel! this mod adds new technology to LegacyClonk.</p>

Clonkworks is a In-development mod for LegacyClonk, that adds a lot of new technology and more stuff to do underground. Alongside that it adds a lot of useful features, systens, and functions.

Currently, you can create many new vehicles in the Advanced Workshop, ranging from a motorbike, to a laser, to a Spider-like cave crawler, and more! You can also build a forge to create special versions of some vehicles, with their stats and properties changing based on the used materials.
